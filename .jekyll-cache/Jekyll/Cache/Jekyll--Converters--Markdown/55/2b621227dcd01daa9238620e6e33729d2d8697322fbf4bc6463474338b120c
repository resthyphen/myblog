I"¾<p>How to write a comment on the blog which is generated by jekyll. my website is using the github comment to fix it
out. This idea mostly based on <a href="https://dc25.github.io/myBlog/2017/06/24/using-github-comments-in-a-jekyll-blog.html">Dave Compton</a> that did a bit more amending. 
When I started to publish my site on github, I realized a problem that how to comment on it. Using jekyll to generate website that is just a static website. If you want to comment on it , you need to get some help
from third party(Disqus etc), maybe it will cause some security problem like  leaking your personal private information. Using github comment has some advantage as follow:</p>
<ul>
      <li>NO need third party any more</li>
	  <li>NO bother with datebase</li>
	  <li>Only use your private repository</li>
	  <li>NO worry about some requsest will track your movement</li>
	  <li>NO advertisement</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, just do some comments on this.</p>
